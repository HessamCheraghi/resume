- Reasamiot Landing Page

  The company's landing page, which showcases their products, required fast load times to enhance user experience and improve SEO rankings. To overcome this challenge, I leveraged Next.js's SSR capabilities. By pre-rendering the page on the server, I was able to reduce the initial load time by 30%, ensuring that users received a fully rendered page upon their first visit.
