Your resume looks good overall! Here are some suggestions for improvement:

**Summary:**

- Consider adding a short, impactful career summary at the top of your resume. This can serve as an elevator pitch that quickly introduces you, your skills, and your career goals.
- Example: "Passionate Front-End Engineer with 2+ years of experience building user-friendly interfaces and scalable applications. Proven ability to collaborate effectively, solve problems creatively, and deliver high-quality code. Seeking a challenging role to contribute to an innovative team."

**Experience:**

- Quantify your achievements: In your experience section, try to quantify your achievements with specific metrics or data whenever possible. This will make your impact more tangible for potential employers.
- Example: "Increased customer satisfaction by 20% through intuitive interface design."
- Tailor your experience to the jobs you're applying for: Highlight the skills and experiences that are most relevant to the specific job you're applying for.

**Projects:**

- Briefly describe each project's purpose and the challenges you faced: Give potential employers a better understanding of the context and complexity of your projects.
- Highlight specific technical skills used: Instead of just listing the project stack, mention the specific technical skills you used in each project.

**Technical Skills:**

- Organize your skills into categories: Divide your technical skills into relevant categories (e.g., Front-End development, Back-End development, etc.) for better readability.
- Consider using skill levels: Indicate your proficiency level for each skill (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).

**Personality Highlights:**

- Focus on skills relevant to the workplace: While the current list showcases positive traits, consider replacing some with skills more crucial in a work environment.
- Example: "Proactive and adaptable," "Effective communicator," "Strong time management skills."

**References:**

- Offer to provide references upon request: Instead of listing references directly on your resume, mention that you are happy to provide references upon request. This saves space and allows you to tailor your references to the specific job.

**Formatting:**

- Consider using a consistent font and font size throughout.
- Use bullet points effectively to highlight key information.
- Ensure appropriate spacing and margins for readability.

Overall, your resume is a good starting point, and with these suggestions, you can make it even stronger and more impactful!
